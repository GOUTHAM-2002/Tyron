| **Start Command** | `gunicorn app:app` |
| **Plan** | `Free` |

### 3.3 Set Environment Variables
1. Click on the **"Environment"** tab
2. Add this environment variable:

2. Wait for the build process (usually 2-5 minutes)
3. Monitor the build logs for any errors

---

## Step 4: Verify Deployment

### 4.1 Check Build Status
- Watch the build logs in Render dashboard
- Look for "Build successful" message
- Note any warnings (they're usually okay)

### 4.2 Test Your Application
1. Once deployed, Render will show your app URL
2. Click the URL to open your application
3. Test the functionality:
   - Upload an avatar image
   - Enter 5 prompts
   - Generate images
   - Verify images are created

### 4.3 Common Build Issues & Solutions

**Issue: Build fails with "Module not found"**
- Solution: Check that `requirements.txt` includes all dependencies

**Issue: "Environment variable not found"**
- Solution: Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set correctly in Render dashboard

**Issue: "Port already in use"**
- Solution: This is normal - Render handles port management automatically

## Step 5: Post-Deployment

### 5.1 Update Your README
Update your GitHub repository README with:
- Live application URL
- Deployment status badge
- Usage instructions

### 5.2 Monitor Your Application

2. Click "Settings" ‚Üí "Custom Domains"
3. Add your domain name
4. Configure DNS settings

- **Runtime:** 750 hours per month
- **Sleep:** Services sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity
- **Storage:** 1GB persistent disk
- **Bandwidth:** 100GB per month

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start
1. Check build logs in Render dashboard
2. Verify `gunicorn app:app` command is correct
3. Ensure all imports work in production

### Images Not Generating
1. Verify OpenAI API key is correct
2. Check API key has sufficient credits
3. Review application logs for errors
